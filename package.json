  "description": "This API includes the data and information about the Harry Porter series. Some of the data accessible herein includes, the names of the characters, the house they belong too   as well as their abilities. Haven come from a background where data is tabularized (Microsoft Excel and SQL Queries), the project was challenging having to work in a NoSQL environment. These challenges also birthed the appreciation for the amount of work that goes into create an API as well as a database as a whole. ## Technical Components Project was built using Express and Mongoose. It included 3 models: Character, House and Spells; with a relationship between the Character and the House Model. In addition, complete CRUD functionality has been implemented with Restful routes across the API, please see below for more details.",
